~ December 20th, 2014 ~
	- Lyons has now been connected... uh oh ;)
	* Server Sided *
	- Disabled DwarfCannon & Must come back to Operate.java to determine why they were disabling it..
	- Renamed all previous SWE Prime/Staff related titles.
	- Colony Gate/Doors (Skilling Area) have been properly disabled.
	- Spirit shard package should be lowered on quantity given.
	- Bankers open some type of moneybank method..? Disabled this.
	
	* Client Sided *
	- Auto-Cache/client Updater has been implemented.
	- Splash.gif has been implemented.
	- Client updater has been disabled for the time being.
	- Mac compatible is still not functioning correctly, Will download the cache correct but not load.
	- Character IDK models now are working properly..
		- Player is still invisible, and username is still buggy. 
		- Pink in the hair has been fixed. <- This caused the player to look UGLY.
		- looking into this.
	TODO:
	* Client sided *
		- Pack cache sprites and fix the login screen to the custom transparent one.  
		- Would be nice for a new client background.. Think it's about time.
	- Underlay/overlay upgrade to 717 rather 530. 
		- This will just upgrade the looks... HD ;)
	- Upgrade the textures to 831, of which I obtained through my buddy.
		- Credits to Frosty teh snowman, Travis.
	- Perhaps drop in the new osrs items, of which i'm ready to drop as well..
		- Any OSRS data can be dumped, Just more time consuming considering I haven't obtained my decoders for the id lists.
	
	* Server Sided *
		- Move home to Varrock castle.
		- Spawn location in garden.
		- Re-do the starter tutorial in order to show the castle instead of edge.
		- Third floor being the training area, look near combat dummys.
		- Second floor being whatever..
		- First floor being shops?
		- Outside being whatever.
		- Look farther into this guys, Home would be best at this location... especially with the levels.
		- Delete Fairy Ring object and replace it with a different method, Perhaps try using lodestones..
			- In order to use lodestones, we would need to upgrade our objects *Jordan* and determine what the object ID would be.
		- Identified the IDK to be 634 yet there is 717 over it? Have to look more into this...
			- The player model becomes invisible once the new looks are applied.
